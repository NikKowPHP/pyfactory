# PyFactory Completion Guide

## Project Overview
The multi-agent workflow system has been successfully implemented with full audit verification. The system now features:

1. **Self-Healing Architecture**
   - Automated retry logic for agent operations
   - Audit-driven correction loops
   - Failure work item generation

2. **Core Components**
   - Planner: Dynamic task generation from specifications
   - Developer: Atomic code implementation
   - Auditor: Semantic verification

## Usage Instructions
```bash
# Start the workflow
python src/main.py --description docs/app_description.md

# Monitor progress (files will be created in these directories):
ls signals/ work_breakdown/tasks/ work_items/

# Final output will be packaged as:
ls *.zip
```

## Maintenance
- Update agent rules in `rules/` directory
- Modify LLM configurations in `config/models.yaml`
- Add new requirements to `docs/Functional_Requirements.md`

## Safety Protocols
- Failed audits auto-generate work items in `work_items/`
- Max 3 retries per operation
- All changes are logged in implementation files
