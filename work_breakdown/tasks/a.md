Of course. Here is the comprehensive, step-by-step implementation plan to fix the critical bugs and implement the core agent logic, moving the project from a simulation to a functional application.

# Engineering Work Plan: Core Logic Implementation

## High-Level Summary
This work plan addresses the critical findings of the latest audit. The project's architecture is sound, but its core functionality is either a placeholder or logically flawed. This plan prioritizes fixing the broken self-correction loop and unused retry mechanism (P0), then focuses on replacing the placeholder agent logic with functional, intelligent implementations (P1). Finally, it includes a cleanup step to reset the system to a clean state (P2). Completing this plan will make the application capable of executing its primary workflow as documented.

### P0 - Critical Bug Fixes
*This tier focuses on fixing critical bugs in the orchestration and feedback loop logic that prevent the system from operating as specified.*

- [x] **[FIX]**: Implement the self-correction feedback loop in the Auditor
    - **File**: `src/core/agents/auditor_agent.py`
    - **Action**: Modify the `_create_audit_result` method. When `result.passed` is `False`, in addition to writing to the signal file, it **must** create a new file in the `work_items/` directory (e.g., `work_items/item-001-audit-failure.md`) containing the discrepancies.
    - **Reason**: Audit finding: "Critical Discrepancy: Self-Correction Loop is Broken. The AuditorAgent does not create a work item on failure, so the Dispatcher's logic to re-route to the Planner is never triggered." (Fixes FR 3.3)

- [x] **[UPDATE]**: Apply the retry decorator to agent execution
    - **File**: `src/core/orchestrator.py`
    - **Action**: Import the `@retry` decorator from `error_handler.py`. Although it cannot be applied directly to `agent.execute()` in the loop, wrap the call in a helper function within the orchestrator that *can* be decorated, or implement the retry logic manually in the loop. The goal is to ensure `agent.execute()` is attempted multiple times on failure.
    - **Reason**: Audit finding: "Discrepancy: Retry Mechanism is Unused. The retry logic is never invoked for agent execution." (Fixes FR 4.1)

### P1 - Implementation of Missing Agent Logic
*This tier focuses on replacing the hollow placeholder logic within each agent with a first-pass functional implementation.*

- [x] **[UPDATE]**: Implement intelligent plan generation in PlannerAgent
    - **File**: `src/core/agents/planner_agent.py`
    - **Action**: Replace the hardcoded list in `_parse_spec_to_work_items`. The method should now read the content of a specification file (e.g., `docs/app_description.md`), perform a basic analysis (e.g., find keywords or headings), and dynamically generate a list of `WorkItem` objects.
    - **Reason**: Audit finding: "[ðŸŸ¡ Partial] Agent System. `PlannerAgent` creates a hardcoded list of tasks instead of parsing specifications."

- [x] **[UPDATE]**: Implement code generation in DeveloperAgent
    - **File**: `src/core/agents/developer_agent.py`
    - **Action**: Replace the placeholder logic in `_implement_work_item`. This method should now perform a tangible file system action based on the `item.description`, such as creating a new file or appending a function definition to an existing file.
    - **Reason**: Audit finding: "[ðŸŸ¡ Partial] Agent System. `DeveloperAgent` marks tasks as complete without writing any code."

- [x] **[UPDATE]**: Implement semantic code audit in AuditorAgent
    - **File**: `src/core/agents/auditor_agent.py`
    - **Action**: Replace the superficial logic in `_perform_audit`. This method should now iterate through the completed work items and perform a basic check on the codebase to verify the work was done (e.g., for a "create function" task, it should check if the function's name exists in the target file).
    - **Reason**: Audit finding: "[ðŸŸ¡ Partial] Agent System. `AuditorAgent` performs a superficial check on a signal file, not a semantic audit of the codebase."

### P2 - Repository State Cleanup
*This tier focuses on resetting the repository to a clean, ready-to-run state.*

- [x] **[FIX]**: Clear the work items directory
    - **File**: `work_items/item-001-audit-failures.md`
    - **Action**: Delete the file `work_items/item-001-audit-failures.md` and ensure the `work_items` directory is empty.
    - **Reason**: Audit finding: "[Anomaly] System is in a Failure State. The presence of this file causes the system to start in a correction loop."
